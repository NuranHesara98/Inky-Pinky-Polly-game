# Inky, Pinky, Polly Game

This Python game allows the player to compete against the computer by choosing between "Inky," "Pinky," or "Polly." The computer makes a random choice, and the game determines the winner based on both selections. The player can continue playing multiple rounds until they choose to stop. Scores are tracked for both the player and the computer, and a final winner is declared based on the total scores. This project demonstrates basic game logic, random choice generation, and user interaction via input prompts.
